# retirement_calculator
graphical calculator for early retirement

Test coding project to learn C++. 

## Choice of language:
Despite C++ obviously not being the ideal choice for this project, this is a challenge to learn more about it by doing something with it that it is not ideal for.

## Features:
#### Main Features:
- Calculate a retirement sum based on saving rate, expected returns and time horizons.
- Display a graph of wealth accumulation over time. 
- Show interactive updates of graph and curve based on parameter updates (scroll-able parameters).
- Calcuate withdrawal curve based on withdrawal rate and accumulated wealth

#### Additional Features:
- Incorporate tax calcuations and consider deferred taxes.
- Parameters for part time retirement until full retirement.
- Allow multiple curves to be overlayed, saving certain settings to be kept as base calculation to be compared.

#### Output:
- The product should either be a simple web- or a standalone application with C++ as its back-end.
